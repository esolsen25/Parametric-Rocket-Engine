V1.0
- Bare bones program that creates parametrically designed rocket engines!
- No README.txt file yet :(
- Also it's pretty disorganized, but we're here for it.
- Probably the most readable version in terms of understanding what it goes through top to bottom with the inserted comments,
  all other versions the code is seperated from one another.
