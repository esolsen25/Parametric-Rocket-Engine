V2.0
- Major organization of main function into multiple subfunctions
	- subfunctions and temporary files moved into corresponding folders to reduce user confusion on what they need to access
		- it took a lot of directory management, but worth it in the end!
- Added figure output for basic contour geometry
- Ordered needed constants and input values to the top of the main function
